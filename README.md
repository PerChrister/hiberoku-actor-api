## Hiberoku, the Actor CRUD API

Hiberoku is a CRUD application using actors as data and is built with Hibernate, Spring, and Postgres database. This web app is mainly backend based and can be tested using the Postman application to test different URLs with different endpoints. One might use the endpoints but only to display information and not to add.
